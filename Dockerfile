# DOCKERFILE for brane-ide
#   by Tim MÃ¼ller
#
# Implements a Dockerfile for the `brane-ide` image.
# 
# There are three layers to this project:
# - The `dev env` layer, which can be used for development and VS Code's in-container mode.
# - The `build` layer, which uses that environment to build the project.
# - The `run` layer, which does not build on the previous layer but provides a fresh, runtime-only environment for the JupyterLab server.
#
